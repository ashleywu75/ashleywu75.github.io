Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a powerful algorithm for decision making, particularly famous for its crucial role in breakthrough AI systems like AlphaGo. Let's dive into what makes MCTS so effective and how it works.

## What is MCTS?

MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm that combines the precision of tree search with the power of random sampling. It's particularly effective in scenarios where:
- The search space is too large for traditional search methods
- It's difficult to create a strong evaluation function
- You need to make decisions with limited computational resources
